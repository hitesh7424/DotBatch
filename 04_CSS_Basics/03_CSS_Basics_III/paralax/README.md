# Creating a Parallax Effect in HTML and CSS

## Idea

A parallax effect creates an illusion of depth by making background images move slower than foreground content as you scroll.

## Steps

1. **HTML Structure**:  
    - Use multiple sections or divs.
    - Assign background images to some sections.

2. **CSS Styling**:  
    - Use `background-attachment: fixed;` for parallax sections.
    - Set `background-size: cover;` and `background-position: center;`.
    - Adjust section heights for visibility.

3. **Example**

```html
<section class="parallax"></section>
<section class="content">Your content here</section>
<section class="parallax"></section>
```

```css
.parallax {
  background-image: url('your-image.jpg');
  min-height: 400px;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
}
.content {
  min-height: 200px;
  background: #fff;
  color: #333;
  padding: 40px;
}
```

## Notes

- Works best on desktop browsers.
- For mobile support, consider using JavaScript or CSS tricks as `background-attachment: fixed;` may not work on all devices.
- Experiment with multiple layers for advanced effects.
